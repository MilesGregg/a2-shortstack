## Technical Achievements
- **Technical Achievement 1**: 
    - When deveopling web reminders application everything was made on a single-page. Whenever the user of the webpage performed an action (create or delete) the tables would update and the inputs would clear. This made it useful because you don't need a change of page or reload.
    - When searching through the table to see which row to delete I used a binary search algoirthm to make the runtime in the worst case O(log n). This overall made the webpage more efficent and had to do less operations.
